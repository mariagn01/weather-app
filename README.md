# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è
Hello üëã Welcome to my weather application, created as a personal project for my portfolio. 

## About the project
The application displays weather data (condition, temperature, humidity and wind speed) for your current location, or any given city. With the users permission, it automatically detect the user's location and displays weather data for this location first. Any city can also be searched for manually.

## Key Features
- Real-time weather information, retrieved from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- Current location weather data, the users location is automatically detected with the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API).
- Search functionality, with input validation and error handling

I also hope to implement more features in the future, such as a fahrenheit/celsius toggle and more responsive design for smaller screens. 

## Technologies used
- HTML is used for the basic structure
- CSS is used for styling and design
- Javascript is used for the application logic and interactive elements
- IDE used is Visual Studio Code
